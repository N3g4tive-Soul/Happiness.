    <h1>Thank You For Caring. &lt;3</h1>
    <p><strong>--[[Written On 5/9/2025 @ 5 AM. Written with Heartfelt Passion with a side of tears. Reviewed 9 times.]]--</strong></p>

    <p>“I don’t know if you’ll ever see this; as you probably and mostly won’t. Buuut perchance if you do, I need you to know what was truthfully going on.</p>

    <p>I didn’t “leave” for “9” months because I stopped caring about you, nonono. I “left” because I didn’t want to drag you down into what I was going through. My grandfather kept getting sick; frequently. And I know — 24 hours in a day; couldn’t I spare 4 hours for you at least? Yes, I could. But there was this one day (I don’t think you’d care enough to read along but I guess I gotta say it otherwise) where I felt extremely weak and I could barely stand up. I went to the doctor and before I even knew it...
    
    <p>There were times where I appeared online, right? I won’t tell you that it wasn’t me, although 90% of the time, it actually wasn’t. Talk about the 10%. I won’t say “I swear,” I’ll say it was for a reason. You won’t believe me — if you do, thank you.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I have BPD. To save you a search, BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder. I know it seems like I’m pulling disorders out of thin air, but I’m not. I’m being TRUTHFUL &lt;3. BPD is where intense emotions and fear of abandonment can cause someone to push loved ones away.</p>

    <p>— I’ll disregard depression because probably both of us are suffering from it, unless you have a different input =] —</p>

    <p>I was scared to mess up something good. Which was you. So I took the first choice: to distance myself to keep our relationship intact. Although... the result was the same. Both choices led to this. I don’t blame you.</p>

    <p>I was hurting. I didn’t know how to say it. And instead of leaning on you, I shut down. I knew it was stupid to not speak to you — I agree, and I still regret and bash my head for it. I thought that if I didn’t open up to you, it wouldn’t affect your mood and make it shitty because you cared about me then.</p>

    <p>Thank you for that, even though I didn’t deserve it. And I wish I could repay that care back to you. Nor did I want you to be worried about me in any way, shape, or form.</p>

    <p>Although I know you think I’m fucking terrible — it’s loud =3.</p>

    <p>You meant everything to me. You still do. I know I sound like a fucking creep. No need to say it. I know it sounds intense, but it’s just the truth.</p>

    <p>I know I messed up. I know I hurt you. But I loved you the whole time, even in silence. I read our chats every day. Literally — not even exaggerating. And if there’s any part of you that still wonders… yes. I still want you back.</p>

    <p>Will I get you back? Probably not. You were too good for me. Your humor, your looks, your personality, your timing, your presence — your everything. =D</p>

    <p><strong>What do I have in return? ==Absolutely Nothing!==</strong></p>
    <p>You really mattered. A lot.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I blew my chance. And there goes this messy phase of love. I don’t think I’m getting another one. If I do, I’ll be stoked.</p>

    <blockquote>
    --Although, if the story about your brother wasn’t true… it’s okay. I was already hurting. I just wish you had trusted me with the truth. I didn’t deserve it. Although I’m just wishing. I knew it was a lie since you said it. You never told me you had a bigger brother. But if that wasn’t a lie? Kudos to you for not lying to me. If it was? My feelings are already hurt. I’m already broken. You and I know you’re better than this. ==I don’t even know how you stayed!==. So just tell me the truth! &lt;3
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Don’t take this message as manipulation. I would never do that to you. It’s stupid. &lt;&lt;&lt;
    </blockquote>

    <p>This isn’t overbearing. Treat it as everything you never saw, wrapped into one last moment of hope. I’m not explaining. I’m letting you in.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>And finally, if you’re even... batting an eye, sleepy guy —</p>
    <p>If you’ve read this 1–2–3–4–5–10 times… just message back at this point. I’ll accept it with open arms. I’m probably reading our older chats right now, anyway. And if you’ve read this message 10 times, know I’ve read all of my mistakes — cried, rethought, daydreamed, and imagined it different — a hundred times.</p>

    <p>Stay Safe. Stay Hydrated. Be You. Have my heart in this writing —</p>

    <p><strong>I miss you. Or I’ll miss you.</strong><br>You decide, Hamoota Dhamsheh. &lt;3</p>

    <p>--By your “Stalker”, Timo.</p>
